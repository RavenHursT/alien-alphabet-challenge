# "Alien Alphabet" Code Challenge

Fun exercise to sharpen one's coding skills.

Given a sorted "dictionary" of "alien" words, derive the order of the characters used.

Example:

Given the dictionary: `["baa", "abcd", "abca", "cab", "cad"]`
The derived alphabet order would be: `[ 'b', 'd', 'a', 'c' ]`

Determined by use of a topological graph sorting.
